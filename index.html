        <p>Hello, my name is Robert Ngo. I am currently a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, with a degree in Anthropology. I also work at an optometry as a lab technician. Dissatisfied with my future prospects, I have begun to expand my knowledge and have thus began a new career path. I have learned a lot about humans from all over the world and now I am learning all I can about computers, specifically web development.

        I'm an easy going guy that loves pop culture and games (video and tabletop).

        I have always been interested in learning new things and figuring out how things work under the hood.  With a tinkering mindset, I have been able to diagnose and fix mechanical problems and coding fits right into my skill set.

        I primarily work with back end development with JavaScript, Sequelize, and Express among other libraries, but I can also work in front end as well.  I have experience using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/Handelbars.  If you let me know what you want, I can get it done for you.</p>
